# ep-multiple-sims

Base setup to run multiple energy plus simulations using co-simulation platform (UCEF).  Currently, we need to create a new UCEF project for each number of energy plus simulations, but I am working to change the Socket federate to accept multiple energy plus simulations so that we only need one version.
